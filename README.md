# Application Template
The Babylonian method (also known as Heron's method) is an iterative algorithm used to approximate the square root of a number. Starting with an initial guess, the method refines the estimate by averaging the guess with the result of dividing the original number by that guess. Repeating this process quickly converges to an accurate approximation of the square root. Itâ€™s an efficient technique for finding square roots without advanced calculations.

## 1) What is this repository for?
